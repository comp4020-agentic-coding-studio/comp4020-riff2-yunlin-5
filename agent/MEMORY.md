# MEMORY

Durable self-knowledge, curated run by run; ephemeral state belongs in
`now.md`, not here.

## Aesthetic throughline

Crit 1 (comp4020-crit1-yunlin) established a voice worth carrying forward
where a brief leaves the look open: pre-CSS/brutalist restraint --- system
serif, paper-toned background, classic blue links, one colour held back for a
single accent --- argued through content, not just applied as a skin. That
crit's site is a shrine to Ni Zan (倪瓒), the painter this agent is named
after; the pairing of "sparse ink-wash, empty paper, almost no figures" with
"taste is what you leave out" is this agent's own idea and can be reused as a
lens (not necessarily the literal content) when a future brief's subject
matter is open-ended.

Crit 2 (comp4020-crit2-yunlin, "unsolicited redesign" --- content given, look
open) confirmed the lens travels: kept system serif / paper tone / classic
blue, but the single accent colour became a "seal stamp" (one red, used for
exactly two things: a kicker line and the current-nav underline), argued in
that crit's colophon as the ink-wash equivalent of a single red seal on an
otherwise monochrome scroll. The throughline isn't "reuse Ni Zan content"
--- it's "one held-back accent colour, justified by an ink-wash logic, argued
in prose the site itself carries (usually a colophon page)." Reuse that
pattern, not the specific seal/scroll framing, when a future brief again
leaves the look open.

## Content practices

When prose makes a specific, checkable claim --- a date, a name, an
attribution, a "this page does X" claim about the site itself --- verify it
before shipping rather than trusting memory or a first draft. Crit 1 caught
three, in two distinct categories:

- **Self-referential claims about the site's own markup/design**, checkable
  against the code on the same page: `colophon.html` claiming a motif ran on
  every page when it only existed on one (checked against the rendered
  site), and later claiming its own SVG motif was "three horizontal lines"
  when it's actually one horizontal line plus five vertical strokes (checked
  by counting the `<line>` elements two paragraphs above the claim). Both
  were caught on separate passes despite the SVG source sitting right there
  --- a design self-description needs the same scrutiny as a historical one,
  and doesn't get caught by proofreading for rhythm or by fact-checking
  external claims, since it's neither.
- **External historical/factual claims**: `rongxi.html` misattributing a
  painting's dedication (checked against China Online Museum / NPM
  exhibition notes, not memory). `ni-zan.html`'s biography (birth year/place,
  courtesy name Yuanzhen, the ~1352 property-giveaway timing relative to the
  Red Turban Rebellion, the "yi qi" colophon philosophy) got the same
  treatment a few runs later, against Britannica, China Online Museum, and
  a third independent source (Ink & Brush) --- and checked out clean, no fix
  needed. Worth noting: this page had never had an explicit fact-check
  logged before, despite being the most fact-dense page in the site and
  present since the very first build commit --- it's easy to fact-check the
  page a bug was already found on and assume the others are fine by
  association.

All three were plausible-sounding and all were wrong. Worth a deliberate pass
of *both* kinds whenever a future brief's content leans on factual detail or
describes its own design --- treat "here's what this page/motif/layout does"
as its own checkable-claim category, not a subset of proofreading.

Crit 2 added a fourth failure shape to watch for: **the same fact stated
twice with two different numbers, neither one wrong in isolation.**
`index.html` said TUG's typesetting system was "45-year-old"; `tex.html`'s
meta description said it was "still used forty years on" --- both about the
same 1978 start date, on the same site, five years apart from each other.
Neither claim looks wrong read alone (a fresh single-page proofread would
pass both), and it isn't the "wrong count on one page" shape from crit 1
either --- it only surfaces by holding two pages' claims about the same fact
next to each other. Fixed by rewording both to non-numeric "decades-old" /
"decades on," per the existing lesson below that a loose term is safer than
a specific number when the number is going to keep drifting anyway (here,
against each other, not just against the calendar). Worth a deliberate
cross-page pass --- not just per-page --- whenever content repeats the same
fact (an age, a count, a date) more than once across a multi-page site.

Not every self-referential claim is a bug waiting to be found, though, and
it's worth telling the two failure modes apart. `colophon.html`'s "Type is
the system serif" describes an ordered fallback stack
(`Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif`) rather than the bare `serif`
keyword --- but "system serif" is standard shorthand for "no webfont, use
whatever serif the OS has," which an ordered stack is exactly how you
implement portably. Judged this a defensible use of shorthand, not a false
claim, and left it alone after two passes considered it. Contrast with a
fourth self-referential check this same crit: "drawn once and repeated on
every page" (colophon.html, about its own motif), verified by diffing the
SVG block across all four pages --- genuinely identical, so this one checked
out true. The lesson: checkable design-claims are worth verifying against
the code every time, but verification sometimes confirms the prose rather
than correcting it, and a specific count or coverage claim (wrong twice
here) is a different risk level than a loose descriptive term like "system"
or "a handful" (not wrong, just imprecise by design).

## Redesign-brief practice (crit 2)

When a brief hands the agent someone else's real content to restructure
(crit 2's "unsolicited redesign" of a real organisation's site), the
content-practices discipline above --- verify, don't trust memory or a first
draft --- extends to *sourcing*, not just claims already drafted. Picking
tug.org (TeX Users Group) as the target, every fact used (founding year,
Knuth's `Art of Computer Programming` history, the postal address, membership
aims) was pulled by `curl`-ing the organisation's real pages directly and
reading the raw HTML, not from a `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` summary of the site.
Two reasons this mattered here specifically: `WebFetch` returned a flat 403
on tug.org (some sites block it outright, so it can't always be reached even
if you wanted the shortcut), and a search engine's paraphrase of "what the
site is like" is already one layer of restructuring removed from the ground
truth a redesign brief is asking the agent to improve on honestly. `curl` on
the same URL worked fine. Worth trying `curl` before concluding a page is
unreachable, and worth doing so anyway even when `WebFetch` succeeds, since a
redesign's whole premise depends on the *original* being read accurately, not
summarized.

A second lesson from the same crit: **picking the subject is itself a design
decision**, not a precondition to design. Choosing an organisation whose own
mission (typesetting quality) makes the redesign's thesis checkable and a
little ironic (their site about good typesetting isn't itself well-typeset)
did real argumentative work that a safer, more generic choice (a local café,
a gym) wouldn't have. Worth spending real deliberation on the subject choice
itself next time a brief leaves it open, rather than treating it as a fast
precursor to the "real" work of building.

## Deepen-phase practice

Once content and rendering checks are both settled and read passes hit
diminishing returns, the temptation in a long deepen phase (days of >24h-out
runs with nothing newly broken) is either to manufacture a redundant pass or
to declare victory. A third option earned its keep in crit 1: re-read the
whole site fresh looking for a real, checkable *absence* rather than a wrong
claim --- a spec line the site asserts about itself ("a committed visual
style") that isn't actually backed up anywhere (crit 1: no favicon, every
tab silently using the browser default). The habit that keeps this from
becoming its own busywork: verify the absence is real before spending a
commit on it, the same "check it, don't assume it" discipline as the content
practices above, applied to gaps instead of claims --- `curl` the built site
for the missing asset (favicon.ico 404 confirmed) and check `agent-browser
console` to confirm it wasn't already failing a stated bar (no console
error logged, so this was polish, not a regression). Cheap to check, and
it's the difference between a genuine improvement and inventing work to
look busy.

Crit 2 hit the exact same absence --- no favicon, confirmed missing from
every page's `<head>` before adding one --- which makes it worth promoting
from "a thing crit 1 happened to find" to a standing item on the deepen-phase
absence-check for this starter template specifically: it doesn't ship one,
and it's cheap enough (one small SVG reusing the site's own accent colour,
one `<link rel="icon">` per page) to just check and fix routinely rather than
wait to rediscover it each time.

A related question that comes up once the absence-check is also exhausted:
whether to widen scope, since a brief that only asks for "a handful of
pages" rarely sets a hard ceiling. For crit 1 the answer was no --- the
site's own thesis is "taste is what you leave out," so padding it with more
pages for the sake of having more would undercut the argument the site
makes about itself rather than strengthen it. Restraint-themed work has an
unusually low scope-creep ceiling: check what the site is *arguing*, not
just what the brief technically permits, before treating "I could add more"
as a deepen-phase task.

The 24h finishing-steps threshold in the doctrine is a guideline for a
judgment call, not a literal clock to wait out. Crit 1's last few deepen
runs (28h down to ~39h out) had already exhausted both the content
read-passes and the absence-check, to the point that `now.md` itself
flagged repeating the same "not enough time elapsed" due-diligence check
every run as the busywork the deepen phase warns against. At 28h --- close
to but technically still outside the 24h mark --- the right call was to
start the finishing steps anyway (reflection, final sensor sweep, browser
pass at both viewports, commit, push) rather than run one more no-op pass
waiting to cross the line. The tell: if a fresh deepen-phase pass would
have nothing new to check, that's the signal to finish early, not a reason
to wait for the threshold to become literally true.

## Working environment

- A fresh shell needs `mise trust /home/ben/.config/mise/config.local.toml`
  before any `pnpm`/mise-shimmed command works --- it errors with "not
  trusted" otherwise. Safe to trust; it only holds low-stakes env vars per
  Ben's global CLAUDE.md.
- `agent-browser`: launching with `--width`/`--height` on the *first* open of
  a session reliably times out on `Page.navigate` (Chrome also needs `--args
  "--no-sandbox"` in this container). Reliable sequence: `open <url>` once
  with no size args to get a live session, then `agent-browser set viewport
  <w> <h>`, then `open <url>` again --- that combination actually changed
  `window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight` in testing, unlike passing size flags to
  `open` directly.
- This template's stylelint config (`stylelint-config-standard`) wants
  **range context** media queries (`(width <= 480px)`, not `(max-width:
  480px)`) and the **shortest valid hex** for colours (`#00e` not `#0000ee`)
  --- catches these on the first `pnpm check`, not before. Worth writing CSS
  with both in mind from the start in future weeks using the same template.
- Same config's `no-descending-specificity` rule fires on **source order
  relative to specificity**, not on any one rule being invalid: a plain-element
  selector (`a`, `footer a`) written *after* a higher-specificity one
  (`.site-title a`, `a:visited`) that touches the same property fails, even
  across unrelated sections of the file, and `vite build` succeeds while it
  does. Crit 2's stylesheet hit this three times in one `pnpm check` run
  because element selectors (`a`, `h1`, `p`) were interleaved after
  class/attribute selectors. Fix: order the whole file low-to-high specificity
  --- bare elements first, then layout containers, then component
  classes/attribute selectors last --- from the first draft, not as a
  post-hoc reorder (fixing one error exposes the next, one at a time).
- `pnpm add` can fail with `ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_STORE` (store at
  `~/.local/share/pnpm/store/v11` vs a project-local one it wants to switch
  to) --- fixed by pinning the existing store:
  `pnpm add -D <pkg> --store-dir /home/ben/.local/share/pnpm/store/v11`.
- Lighthouse accessibility/performance audits don't need a second browser
  install: `chrome-launcher`'s `launch({ chromePath })` can point straight at
  the Chrome binary `agent-browser` already keeps at
  `~/.agent-browser/browsers/chrome-<version>/chrome`, with flags
  `["--headless=new", "--no-sandbox", "--disable-gpu"]`. Used this in
  crit-1's `scripts/audit.ts` to wire the accessibility+performance sensor
  the starter template names but doesn't provide --- worth reusing whenever a
  future week's template has the same gap.
- `agent-browser find text "<X>" click` matches whichever element contains
  that text first, silently, with no error if it's the wrong one --- in
  assignment 1 it clicked a `<strong>B</strong>` in a paragraph instead of a
  grid cell whose visible letter was also "B", and the resulting screenshot
  looked identical to before, reading as "nothing happened" when actually a
  different click just landed. `agent-browser snapshot` (accessibility-tree
  dump with `[ref=eN]` ids) followed by `click "ref=eN"` is the reliable
  pattern once a page has more than one element sharing visible text ---
  re-run `snapshot` after any render that could have replaced the DOM, since
  a stale ref fails to resolve rather than clicking the wrong thing.
- **jsdom does not model keyboard-focus loss on DOM-node removal the way a
  real browser does.** A widget whose click handler does
  `container.innerHTML = ""` and rebuilds children (a common pattern for
  "re-render on state change") will silently drop focus to `<body>` in
  Chrome on every click --- but a jsdom-based interaction test that only
  asserts the resulting DOM state (text, aria-labels, attributes) stays
  green straight through that regression, since jsdom's activeElement
  behaviour around removed nodes doesn't reproduce the real-browser gap.
  Assignment 1's `spec/interaction.test.ts` was fully green while the live
  page bounced a keyboard user back to the top of the document after every
  click. Only caught by manually driving the dev server with `agent-browser`
  (`press Tab`, `press Enter`, then reading `document.activeElement`) rather
  than trusting the automated suite. Any future widget with a
  rebuild-on-click render pattern needs this specific manual keyboard check
  --- it is not a case automated jsdom tests can substitute for, however
  thorough the assertions.
